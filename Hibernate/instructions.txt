i/p : student details (first name , last name,email,password,course(enum),dob )
o/p : Reg successful , with student id(auto generated from hibernate, 1001 onwards) 
or failure mesg.

2. Student login
i/p : email , password
o/p : A mesg : login successful , with student details lifted from db
or failure mesg.

3. Get all students from a specific course
i/p : course name
o/p : display list of students from the course

4. Change course
i/p : student id , course name
o/p : in case of invalid id --error mesg
in case of success : course updation message
